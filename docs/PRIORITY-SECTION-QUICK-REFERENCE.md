# Priority Section Quick Reference

## What is the Priority Section?

The Priority Section is a dedicated area at the top of your open todos that helps you focus on your most important tasks using the "Eat the Frog" productivity principle - tackle your most challenging or important task first.

## How to Use

### üìç Location

- Found in the **"Open" tab only** (not in completed todos)
- Appears **above** your regular todos
- Has its own "Priority" heading with a count of priority todos

### üéØ Adding Priority Todos

1. **Drag and Drop**: Simply drag any todo from the "Other" section into the "Priority" section
2. **Visual Feedback**: The priority section will highlight when you drag a todo over it
3. **Automatic Update**: The todo is immediately marked as priority and gets a light yellow background

### üì§ Removing Priority Status

1. **Drag and Drop**: Drag a todo from the "Priority" section back to the "Other" section
2. **Instant Change**: The todo loses its priority status and yellow background

### üé® Visual Indicators

- **Priority Todos**: Light yellow background (`warning.light`)
- **Dark Mode**: Darker yellow background for better contrast
- **Empty State**: Dashed border box with motivational text when no priority todos exist
