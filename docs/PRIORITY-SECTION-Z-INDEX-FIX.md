# Priority Section Z-Index Fix

## Issue

When dragging todos into the priority section, they would sometimes become invisible after being dropped.

## Root Cause

Z-index stacking context issues were causing dropped items to appear "behind" their container elements. Specifically:

1. The `DraggableTodoItem` component was using `z-index: 'auto'` when not being dragged, which could cause it to be rendered behind other elements with explicit z-index values.
2. The priority section container had a `z-index: 1` which could potentially create stacking context issues.
3. Proper positioning context wasn't established in the container elements.

## Solution

We made the following changes to fix the z-index issues:

1. Updated `DraggableTodoItem.tsx` to always use a numeric z-index value (1 when not dragging, 1000 when dragging).
2. Added `position: relative` to the priority section containers to establish proper stacking context.
3. Removed explicit z-index declarations from containers that didn't need them and replaced with proper positioning.

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/DraggableTodoItem.tsx` - Changed z-index from 'auto' to 1 for non-dragging state
2. `/src/components/TodoList.tsx` - Added proper positioning context to the priority section containers

## Testing Recommendations

- Test dragging todos from regular section to priority section
- Test dragging todos within the priority section
- Test dragging todos from priority section back to regular section
- Verify that todos remain visible at all times during and after drag operations
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices
- Test with dark mode enabled
